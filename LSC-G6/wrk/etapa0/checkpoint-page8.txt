On Stage -1


as -o lscboot.bin lscboot.o
-> Reads and assembles a source file.

ld -T bootrec.ld -o lscboot.bin lscboot.o
-> ld: GNU linker
-> "-T" option to replace the default linker script entirely

dd if=/dev/zero of=lsc.fd bs=512 count=2880
-> dd: convert and copy file
-> if: read from FILE instead of stdin
-> of: write to FILE instead of stdout
-> bs: force ibs=BYTES and obs=BYTES
-> count: copy only BLOCKS input blocks

dd if=lscboot.bin of=lsc.fd bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc
-> conv: convert the file as per the comma separated keyword list

I think that: if file /dev/zero it was copied to lsc.fd and create a empty floppy disk,
so we can copy file lsc-hd63-flat.img
About blocks we know that second partition starts on block 43344 and this lenght is 43868160.

I couldn't test because Virtual Machine Ware don't allow me to run from a floppy disk, but any error do not came out.
I just had to put all path of file .img


as -o lscboot.bin lscboot.o
-> lscboot.s its the same that stage -1

ld -T bootrec.ld -o lscboot.bin lscboot.o

dd if=/home/elvisp/lsc/disks/lsc-hd63-flat.img of=lsc.fd bs=512 count=43868160 seek=43344

dd if=lscboot.bin of=lsc.fd bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc
